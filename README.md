# NBA Player Composite Impact Rating (CIR) Shiny App
# Overview
Welcome to the NBA Player Composite Impact Rating (CIR) Shiny App repository. This project provides a comprehensive and interactive platform to evaluate and visualize the overall impact of NBA players. By integrating advanced data analytics and user-friendly interfaces, this app enables users to explore how various metrics contribute to a player's performance and influence on the game.
